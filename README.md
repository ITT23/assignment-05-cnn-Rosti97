## Task 1
Hyperparameter: batch-size

The folder contains the jupyter-notebook, a pdf of this notebook (to make sure the results are saved and the cells not run fresh) and a results.pdf for the approach and results without the code structure.

## Task 3 
Prediction of hand gestures begin as soon as the paper with the 4 aruco marker is tracked. Hold the paper vertically (hands/arms will not block an aruco marker as fast as horizontal).

Control-Mapping:
| hand-gesture | media control | comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| like | volume up |
| dislike | volume down |
| stop | pause / play | there's a 1.5 s timeout after trigger |
