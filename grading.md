## Hößl (13.5/15P)

### 1 Exploring Hyperparameters (3.5/5P)

 * hyperparameter values make sense
   * yes (1P)
 * networks were trained correctly
   * yes (1P)
 * there are results
   * yes (1P)
 * report and visualization
   * inference time missing - inference time is the time for one prediction, not training time (-0.5P)
   * the notebook is very long with lots of duplicate code - you could have used a function to train an test the model, or simply a constant you change before training (-1P)
   * aggregated results in a table (0.5P)

### 2 Dataset (5/5P)

 * sufficient images captured
   * yes (1P)
 * sufficient images annotated
   * yes (2P)
 * annotations compatible with HaGRID dataset
   * yes (1P)
 * confusion matrix
   * yes (1P)

### 3 Media Controls (5/5P)

 * three hand poses are tracked and distinguished reliably
   * yes (2P)
 * three media control features implemented
   * yes (1P)
 * mapping works and makes sense
   * yes (1P)
 * low latency
   * kind of (1P)
